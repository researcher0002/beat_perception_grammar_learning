The names of the conditions in the Pavlovia folder do not match the ones used for the article which were chosen at later stages of the study to allow better clarity of the experimental desing. Here a legend, shwoing the new conditon names and their correspondent original ones:

- RB+ --> Conj_un
- RB- --> Conj_syn
- R --> What
- B --> When

The folders with stimuli and the .csv files used to iterate the stimuli for each condition in the experiment are the exact output obtained from the scripts used for the synthesis of the material.
